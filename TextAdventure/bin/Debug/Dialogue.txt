I never thought I would live to see the end of the world. Mutual destruction should've been enough, right? I guess if you can get the drop on someone they can't fight back, but why risk it? Why did they have to risk it when I'm protecting the president? Can barely even think, let alone stop throwing up and leaking everywhere. Gotta find out if anyone's alive. Come on. Come on. Where am I?
