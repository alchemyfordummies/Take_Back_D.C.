# Take_Back_D.C.
A text based adventure game.
    The loose concept is that sometime in the future, the country is attacked in a big way, by nuclear weapons specifically.
Not sure how I'll explain that getting by the military, but whatever, first things first. Essentially, one new secret
service agent tries to make his way through the wreckage of the white house to check on the safety of his superiors. 
The radiation has caused rampant mutation in everyone, even him. It seems to have caused aggression, as they all try
to attack him as he goes. His own mutations change his state of mind, making him think more logically or more violently or 
more focused, etc. This will probably be a fairly short game and since I don't have much experience at all, it'll probably
be far simpler than what I have in mind, but it'll be a simple RPG, since I don't know what to do about an EXP system, I'm 
planning to just do beat an enemy, go up a level. It will probably only be a few rooms, perhaps 4, we can say he starts in 
the basement or something.
